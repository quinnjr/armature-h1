//! End-to-end benchmark: one full request/response cycle through `Connection`.
//!
//! Over `tokio::io::duplex` rather than a real socket, on purpose. A loopback TCP
//! benchmark measures the kernel's network stack more than it measures this
//! crate — syscall and scheduling cost dominates, and the numbers move with
//! unrelated kernel settings. What is interesting here is the crate's own cost per
//! request: parse, dispatch, serialize, and the state-machine transition back to
//! reading. `scripts/bench-h1.sh` covers the socket path against a real client.
//!
//! The server runs on its own thread with its own current-thread runtime and
//! `LocalSet`, and the benchmark drives the client half from the criterion thread.
//! That is not an implementation detail to skip past: `Connection` is `!Send` (it
//! holds `Rc`s), and driving both halves from one current-thread runtime would
//! mean either nesting `block_on` inside `block_on` or spinning on a thread whose
//! `LocalSet` owns the server task — the second starves the very task the
//! benchmark is waiting on. Two threads costs a cross-thread wakeup per request,
//! which is real and included in the numbers below; the microbenchmarks in
//! `parse.rs`/`write.rs` are the place to read per-stage cost without it.
//!
//! Each iteration drives an already-warm keep-alive connection, so buffer growth
//! and task setup sit outside the measurement — the same steady state the allocation
//! regression test asserts costs zero allocations.
