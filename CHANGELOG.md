# Changelog — `armature-h1`

All notable changes to this crate will be documented in this file.

and this crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Chunked line-length limits were bypassable by packetization.** The bound on
  a chunk-size line and on a trailer line was enforced only while the decoder
  was still waiting for the terminating LF. A peer that delivered an over-long
  line in a single segment arrived with the LF already present, so the length
  was never checked and the line was accepted whole — meaning the limit
  constrained only senders that dribbled bytes, which is the opposite of the
  threat. Both limits now apply however the input is split. The trailer path
  additionally reported the wrong error depending on arrival: `MissingCrlf`
  when dribbled, `TrailerTooLarge` when delivered at once; it is now
  `TrailerTooLarge` either way.

- **Two remaining response-desync vectors closed.** A 204, 304 or 1xx response
  now drops any body a handler attached: the writer already suppresses their
  framing field, so writing body bytes anyway left them unaccounted for and a
  keep-alive peer read them as the next response. And a handler
  `Content-Length` that disagrees with the body it framed is dropped in favour
  of the true length, rather than trusted verbatim — response splitting reached
  through arithmetic instead of through a CRLF.

- **Request smuggling on the fixed-length body path.** `take_buffered` is
  bounded by what the body is owed, but `fill` is not — it hands over the whole
  socket read. When a `Content-Length` body straddled two reads and the second
  carried the front of a pipelined request, those bytes were dropped while the
  body still reported itself fully read, so keep-alive survived and the peer's
  response queue shifted by one. The chunked decoder already returned its
  residue; the fixed-length arm now does too.

- Every deadline in `Limits` is now enforced against something that polls it.
  `body_timeout` was armed and never awaited, so it had no effect at all — and
  its test passed by reaching the idle timeout instead. `write_timeout` now
  covers every flush of a streamed body rather than only the final write.
- Handler-supplied header and trailer values containing CR, LF or NUL are
  rejected, and `HeaderId::Other` names are re-validated as tokens. Response
  splitting is request smuggling run backwards, and the framing checks now
  consult what was actually emitted so a dropped `Content-Length` cannot leave a
  response undelimited.
- `Transfer-Encoding` on an HTTP/1.0 request is rejected (the TE-downgrade
  smuggling vector), and `#` is rejected in the request target — RFC 9110 §7.1
  puts a fragment outside it, and no RFC 9112 §3.2 form admits one.
- `Response::upgrade`, `BufPool` and `Limits::max_pipeline_depth` are removed.
  Each was public API that did nothing: the callback was only ever dropped
  unrun, the pool had no call sites while the README documented its
  observability, and the pipeline cap was never read.

### Added — `0.1.0` (new crate)

A zero-allocation HTTP/1.1 server layer. The steady-state request path — parse,
dispatch, write — performs no heap allocations at all, which
`tests/alloc_regression.rs` asserts against a budget of zero per request.

Types:

- `Method` — well-known methods are unit variants, so dispatch is a discriminant
  comparison; an unrecognized token is carried as `Method::Other(ByteStr)`.
  Includes `QUERY` (draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body). `From<&str>`,
  `From<String>`, `PartialEq<str>`, `PartialEq<&str>` and `Display` let it stand
  in for the `String` it replaces at a call site.
- `ByteStr` — an immutable UTF-8 string backed by `Bytes`, so a request target or
  header value can be a refcounted slice of the connection's read buffer rather
  than a fresh `String`. Derefs to `str`; `Hash` delegates to `str` so the
  `Borrow<str>` impl is sound for map lookups.
- `HeaderId` — well-known header names as an enum, with `header::intern` mapping
  a name to one (lowercasing an unrecognized name so lookups stay
  case-insensitive), and `HeaderVec` keeping 16 headers inline.
- `Version`, `Limits`, `ConnConfig`, `Connection`, `Request`, `Response`,
  `DateCache`.

Framing follows RFC 9112 §6: `framing::decide` resolves `Transfer-Encoding` and
`Content-Length` together and rejects the combinations that enable request
smuggling, including `Transfer-Encoding` on an HTTP/1.0 request (the TE-downgrade
vector). Request targets are validated against RFC 3986's character set and
RFC 9112 §3.2's four target forms; a `#` fragment is rejected, since RFC 9110
§7.1 puts it outside the request target.

The reverse direction is covered too: a handler-supplied header or trailer whose
value contains CR, LF, or NUL — or whose `HeaderId::Other` name is not an RFC
9110 token — is dropped rather than written, and the writer frames the response
as if it had never been supplied. Response splitting is request smuggling run
backwards.

Every deadline in `Limits` is enforced against something that polls it: the
header and idle deadlines against the head read, the body deadline against the
handler call itself, and the write deadline against *every* flush of a streamed
response rather than only the last.

Protocol upgrades leave through `Connection::serve`'s `Ok(Some(Upgraded))`.
`Server` has no upgrade-consumer hook and closes such connections; a service that
upgrades must drive `Connection` itself.

`Connection` is `!Send` by design — it holds `Rc`s — and is driven on a
thread-per-core runtime with `SO_REUSEPORT`.

The crate keeps `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`; the counting allocator the regression
test needs lives in the test target, not the library.

Fuzzing: three `cargo-fuzz` targets (`parse_head`, `chunked`,
`framing_differential`). The differential target compares framing decisions
against hyper and panics only when both implementations accept a message but
disagree on its body length — which is what a smuggling primitive looks like.
